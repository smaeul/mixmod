SYNOPSIS
In the interest of having fewer zipfiles to flash every time I update or change
the firmware on my Galaxy Nexus, I have created a script to remove stuff I don't
use and add stuff I do. This script allows you to combine any number of mods in
a single zipfile. It is intended to be easily extendable by adding additional
scripts for each feature, like sound enhancements, a custom hosts file, inverted
apps, the "official" (or another) Google Apps package, and adding or removing
arbitrary files from /system. This mod uses a script in /system/addon.d to keep
(and re-apply) changes through firmware updates on compatible ROMs, like CM and
Slim. I am providing this script in hopes that it will be useful, but there is
ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

CONFIGURATION
Edit the variables, comment out what you don't want, and add what you do. It's
all up to you. I believe I have explained any quirks for the options; basically
those are limitations in my knowledge of Unix text processing voodoo (or things
I just haven't bothered to implement).

DEVICES
This script was originally intended to work only with the Galaxy Nexus. It has
been extended for a few devices, BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE IT WILL WORK FOR YOU.
If you want to use it with another device, you will need to create a device
definition, including at least the path for the /system partition.

LICENSE
I am making this script available under the MIT/X11 license, so basically you
are free to do whatever. If you think you can improve the script for everyone,
I am quite open to contributions. Below is a list of things I'd like to get to.

WRITING PLUGINS
All variables must be namespaced by being prefixed with the plugin name. The
DEVICE namespace is reserved for per-device settings. Some "global" variables
will be significant to you; you will probably need to append things to them:
ALL_DIRS, ALL_PLUGINS, etc. You should gate your plugin behind a variable
named <plugin>_ENABLED which should be set with ?= to no when it is submitted
(to help avoid breaking things). Gating behind DEVICE or ANDROID_VERSION for
limited-compatibility mods also helps. Extracted files go in a directory named
after your plugin inside TMPDIR. See the existing plugins for examples.
