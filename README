SYNOPSIS
In the interest of having fewer zipfiles to flash every time I update or change
the firmware on my Galaxy Nexus, I have created a script to remove stuff I don't
use and add stuff I do. This script allows you to combine any number of mods in
a single zipfile. It is intended to be easily extendable by adding additional
scripts for each feature, like sound enhancements, a custom hosts file, inverted
apps, the "official" (or another) Google Apps package, and adding or removing
arbitrary files from /system. This mod uses a script in /system/addon.d to keep
(and re-apply) changes through firmware updates on compatible ROMs, like CM and
Slim. I am providing this script in hopes that it will be useful, but there is
ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

CONFIGURATION
Edit the variables, comment out what you don't want, and add what you do. It's
all up to you. I believe I have explained any quirks for the options; basically
those are limitations in my knowledge of Unix text processing voodoo (or things
I just haven't bothered to implement).

DEVICES
This script was originally intended to work only with the Galaxy Nexus. It has
been extended for a few devices, BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE IT WILL WORK FOR YOU.
If you want to use it with another device, you will need to change the device
path for /system in the updater-script and possibly use another updater-binary.

LICENSE
I am making this script available under the MIT/X11 license, so basically you
are free to do whatever. If you think you can improve the script for everyone,
I am quite open to contributions. Below is a list of things I'd like to get to.

WRITING PLUGINS
All exported variables must be namespaced and in all caps. There are three
reserved namespaces: BASE, DEVICE, and RUNME. You should use your plugin name
as its namespace.

TO DO
* Add support for kernel integration.
* Add support for "zero" hosts (and test if it's better on Android).
* Extract native libraries from added apps so they work right.
* Use inverts from new "Team Black Out" website.
